# Cortex

[Cortex](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/CortexDocs) offers a powerful observable (URL, file, IP, etc) analysis mechanism. It allows you to analyze collected observables using a single tool, respond to threats, and interact with the constituency and other teams.

::: tip ðŸ”‘ Credentials
You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/Cortex/README.md).

## Basic Operations

<Resource node="n8n-nodes-base.cortex" />

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to analyze a URL and get the job details using the Cortex node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/809) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [Cortex]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

![A workflow with the Cortex node](REDACTED)

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Cortex node (analyzer: execute)

This node will analyze a URL. If you want to analyze a different observable type, select that instead.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Cortex node. You can find out how to do that [here](../../../credentials/Cortex/README.md).
2. Select 'Abuse_Finder_3_0' from the ***Analyzer Type*** dropdown list.
3. Select 'URL' from the ***Observable Type*** dropdown list.
4. Enter the URL you want to analyze in the ***Observable Value*** field.
5. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node starts the analysis of the URL.

### 3. Cortex1 node (job: get)

This node will return the job details for the analysis that we executed in the previous node.
::: v-pre
1. Select the credentials that you entered in the previous node.
2. Select 'Job' from the ***Resource*** dropdown list.
3. Click on the gears icon next to the ***Job ID*** field and click on ***Add Expression***.
4. Select the following in the ***Variable Selector*** section: Nodes > Cortex > Output Data > JSON > _id. You can also add the following expression: `{{$node["Cortex"].json["_id"]}}`.
5. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.
