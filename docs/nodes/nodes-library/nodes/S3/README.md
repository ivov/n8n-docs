# S3

S3 is an object storage service that allows you to block public access to all of your objects at the bucket or the account level with S3 Block Public Access. S3 maintains compliance programs, such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITECH, FedRAMP, EU Data Protection Directive, and FISMA, to help you meet regulatory requirements.

::: tip ðŸ”‘ Credentials
You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/S3/README.md).
:::

## Basic Operations

<Resource node="n8n-nodes-base.s3" />

**Note:** To attach a file for upload, you will need to use an additional node such as the [Read Binary File](../../core-nodes/ReadBinaryFile/README.md) node or the [HTTP Request](../../core-nodes/HTTPRequest/README.md) node to pass the file as a data property.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to upload a file to an S3 compatible server and get a list of all the files in a bucket using the S3 node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/674) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [HTTP Request](../../core-nodes/HTTPRequest/README.md)
- [S3]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

5. Select the following in the ***Variable Selector*** section: Nodes > HTTP Request > Output Data > Binary > data > fileName. You can also add the following expression: `{{$node["HTTP Request"].binary.data.fileName}}`
6. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.
