This workflow allows you to get details of a forum in Disqus. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/493) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [Disqus]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.
