This workflow allows you to create, update, and get an activity in Strava. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/744) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [Strava]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
