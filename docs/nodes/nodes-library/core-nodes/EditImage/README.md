# Edit Image

The Edit Image node is used to manipulate and edit images.

::: tip ðŸ’¡ Keep in mind
1. If you are not running n8n on Docker, you'll need to install [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/README.html).
2. You will need to use an additional node such as the [Read Binary File](../../core-nodes/ReadBinaryFile/README.md) node or the [HTTP Request](../../core-nodes/HTTPRequest/README.md) node to pass the image file as a data property to the Edit Image node.

## Node Reference

- Operations
	- Add a blur to the image to reduce sharpness
	- Add a border to the image
	- Create a new image

	- Get information about the image
	- Rotate the image
	- Change the size of the image

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to add text to an image downloaded from the internet using the Edit Image node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/591) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [HTTP Request](../../core-nodes/HTTPRequest/README.md)
- [Edit Image]()


The final workflow should look like the following image.
