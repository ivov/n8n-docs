## Basic Operations

<Resource node="n8n-nodes-base.git" />

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to add, commit, and push changes to a git repository. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1115) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [Git]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
